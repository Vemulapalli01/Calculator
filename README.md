# Calculator

**Mission Statement:**

Our mission with the open-source calculator software is to create a reliable and user-friendly tool that provides both basic and advanced calculations with ease. We aim to improve the functionality and aesthetics of the calculator by fixing existing bugs, adding new features, and enhancing the visual appeal of the user interface.

**Code of Conduct:**

As contributors to an open-source project, we abide by a code of conduct that promotes respectful and inclusive behavior. We encourage open communication, constructive feedback, and collaboration among all members of the open-source community.

**Overview of Changes Made:**

Our team worked on an existing calculator software with the goal of improving its functionality and aesthetics. We fixed a bug with the zero button and added parentheses, arcSin, arcCos, arcTan, e^x, 10^x, root, and mod functions. We also improved the button layout by replacing text with symbols and added hover and button-pressed visual markers for a better user experience.

**Unfinished Changes and Contemplated Improvements:**

We faced challenges in implementing the parentheses function and improving the GUI due to the limitations of Java Swing. In the future, we recommend exploring different GUI toolkits and reorganizing the calculator's logic structure to enable more flexibility and functionality. Additionally, we considered adding the ability to type in commands and store calculation history as potential improvements.

**Testing Procedure:**

We conducted manual testing procedures by performing a series of button presses and inputting various mathematical expressions to verify the accuracy of our calculations. We would like to have outsourced user testing done in the future to gain feedback on how real-world users will use the software.

**Responsibilities**

Penelope was responsible for the aesthetics of the calculator, which included improving the user interface (UI) and its visual appeal. She replaced button text with math symbols to make it easier for users to understand the functions and added hover and button pressed visual aids for a better user experience.

Rishi was responsible for improving the functionality of the calculator by fixing bugs and adding new functions. He added advanced mathematical functions such as arcCos, arcSin, arcTan, e^x, 10^x, root, and mod to the calculator's repertoire.
